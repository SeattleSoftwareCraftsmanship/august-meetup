Fork this repo, then...

In the language of your choice, write some code that, given an integer between zero and 500, returns the textual representation of that number.

Examples:

0 => "zero"

7 => "seven"

14 => "fourteen"

65 => "sixty-five"

142 => "one hundred and forty-two"

When you're done (or time is up) submit a pull request and we'll review the solution.

Have FUN! :)
